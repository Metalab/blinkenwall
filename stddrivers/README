Drivers for the stdin/stdout buffer exchange protocol
=====================================================

The following devices are supported:

* lineflip: Wolfgang's table
* pipeofant: the blinkofant panels, formerly ice stadion panel

Protocol
--------

All drivers expect their video data on stdin, in chunks of complete buffers
contents.

The buffer dimensions and bytes per pixel have to be negotiated externally. The
bytes are interpreted as 8 bit unsigned integers corresponding to brightness.
In one-byte-per-pixel mode, data is usually interpreted as grayscale values,
three-byte-per-pixel is interpreted as 8 bit red, 8 bit green, and 8 bit blue.

The exact meanings of color values are unspecified. Drivers that can just
display on and off states commonly interpret values up to 0x30 as off and above
as on; as an effect, they take ASCII 0 and 1 characters for off and on.

That consideration also motivates the pixel sequence, which is top row first
from left to right, and then (without any line breaks) the following rows up to
the last. No padding or similar is used. Clients are expected to write out
their complete buffer contents in one block.

Implementations can use ASCII art, map the characters to color values (unless
they use 1 and 0 on a single-bit display) and just strip out the newlines.
